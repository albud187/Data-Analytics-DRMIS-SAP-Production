for vehicles of interest:
- find out which ones have most days WIP  
word embedding + clustering on work order description, then expand to all vehicles RCAF / CF wide

clustering based on word similarity type models:
comparison words:
- vocabulary words extracted from features

- or -

- words from work order description

which vehicles have most amoutn of time - CFR
find CFRs with most open work orders
find CFRs with work order open more than past date


create tools and functionalization:
- find out which vehicles (type) cause the most work orders
- find out which vehicles (CFR) cause most work orders
- find out which vehicles cause the most work order types
- which work centers have the most work orders
- which work centers have the most hours of work


return data frames of vehicles

outputs
list which vehicles have active work orders against them and how many, 
list which vehicles have active work orders against them, still open since x days ago

- dataframe cols = CFR, number work orders active, planned hours, work center, vehicle type,
